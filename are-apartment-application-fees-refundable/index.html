E If the landlord rejects an applicant and the landlord has not made the notice required by Subsection a available the landlord shall return the application fee and any application deposit.

<p>Apartment application fees are non-refundable and are required for your application to be processed. In most states a landlord does not have to refund the rental application fee but in others they may. This will depend on your state. Again the rules are different in different areas so before applying for an apartment read the fine print regarding whether an application fee is refundable.
