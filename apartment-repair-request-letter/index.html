<p>When you receive a maintenance work order form you can handle the problem more effectively because the form provides all the information youll need to deal with it. Its a good idea to document that the repair request has been sent and received by sending the letter both certified and regular first class mail and keeping a copy. On the other hand if tenants use repair request forms you will have a precise and clear record of who makes the request when they made it and what the request is. When it comes to repairs on your rental its wise to create a paper trail of your requests in case there are ever issues regarding maintenance in the future.
