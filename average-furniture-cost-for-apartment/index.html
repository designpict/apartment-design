<p>Between necessities 2782 and essentials 3245 the average cost of furnishing an apartment is around 6000. It would easily run twice that in the summer if you must run air conditioning. Property taxes have nearly doubled during the past 10 years posting an increase in excess of 10 percent in 2018 and now average 2030 per unit. When renting furniture for your whole home or apartment many rental furniture providers offer home furnishing packages for much less than if you were to rent each piece individually although these packages can get pricey for larger and more luxurious collections.
