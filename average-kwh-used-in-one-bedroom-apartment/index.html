<p>According to my experience and data from monitoring projects Ive deployed in housing mainly apartments in Spain with two rooms and 23 people per apartment average consumption should be around 6 kWhday. Every household is different but an average gives a basic idea of where it could be consumed This household uses an average of 41 kWh per day average cost 901 per day Heating and cooling is not used all year round so real daily consumption is much higher. My much smaller 1 bedroom had a similar trend but subtract 200-300kwh. Average kWh per day - 1 bed flat. Warehouse Gym D3 Vshd Design Warehouse Gym Design District Gym Design.</p>

<p>So how much electricity does an average apartment dweller use. If there are 2 adults in a one bedroom flat then the average. Buy 1 gallon or 10 its all the same price per gallon. These estimates calculate that for a 1 or 2-bedroom house average gas consumption currently stands at around 8000kWh with electricity consumption approximately 2000kW.
