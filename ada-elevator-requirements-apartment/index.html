<p>An elevator should never be required for apartments for the above reason. An elevator is not required because each floor has less than 3000 square feet. This requires landlords to make rental spaces accessible for anyone with a disability so they can access the property equally. If these elevator ADA codes had been implemented the elevator would not have been shut down for thirty days for risk of violating ADA elevator requirements and the woman would have been found and promptly removed from the elevator cab.
