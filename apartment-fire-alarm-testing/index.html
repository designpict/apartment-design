Managing agents are advised to compile a fire safety manual for the fire systems in the building so these records are maintained in a central location for audit and inspection. You trip an alarm then go around and verify each hornstrobe is flashing and sounding as quickly as possible. Typically facility personnel are limited to performing inspection and some basic testing activities only.
