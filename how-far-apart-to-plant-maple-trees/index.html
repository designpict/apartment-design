<p>Japanese Maples prefer soil that is well-drained but moist neutral to slightly acidic and nutrient rich. If possible space the trees between 40 and 50 feet apart for the best root and canopy spacing. However if you avoid freezing and hot temperatures you can plant your Maple almost any time of the year. Use about one cup of a well-balanced 10-10-10 granular fertilizer around the base of a newly planted Amur maple in the early spring after fall planting or six to eight weeks after spring planting to encourage rapid growth.
