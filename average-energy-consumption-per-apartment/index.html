<!-- Head tag Code -->
<p><strong>Average Energy Consumption Per Apartment</strong>, 30 minutely electricity consumption. The average power consumption for an apartment 800 ft 2 is 4056 kWh per year which is about 338 kWh per month. Roughly 14 KWhday so at 30 days that would be 420 Kwh.</p>

<p>For the average condo that is about 1310 ft 2 in size we estimate average annual consumption to be about 7008 kWh electricity per year. 28 - 60 per month. The UK average energy usage from 1st April 2020 is 12000kwh Gas and 2900kwh Electricity. Heres how much you can expect to pay monthly for each utility.</p>
<h3 id="the-average-electricity-consumption-for-a-single-detached-home-1800-ft-2-is-8292-kwh-per-year-or-about-691-kwh-per-month">The average electricity consumption for a single detached home 1800 ft 2 is 8292 kWh per year or about 691 kWh per month.</h3><p>28 - 60 per month. This is multiplied by the UKs average unit gas price of 444 pencekWh as per Ofgem reporting here. So there you have it. In Victoria the average annual electricity bill was found to be just over 1012. On my first bill on a 22 day billing cycle it was 304KWh. Figure 3 shows average energy consumption per square foot steadily declining by year built.</p>

<p>If there are 2 adults in a one bedroom flat then the average energy costs are between 46 and 73. This estimate includes the basic utilities - electricity gas and water. The average electric bill for a 1 bedroom apartment per month is about 50-90 depending on where you live. The on-site load can be estimated by using a calculation of 2 wattssquare foot of livable space eg an 800-square-foot apartment unit may benefit from a PV system up to 1600 watts or 16 kWSpeak with your solar contractor to understand how this estimated system size will reduce your utility bill depending on your applicable rate structure.

<p>For the average condo that is about 1310 ft 2 in size we estimate average annual consumption to be about 7008 kWh electricity per year. Feel free to bookmark this page and check back in future to see how the average UK households energy usage has changed. According to my experience and data from monitoring projects Ive deployed in housing mainly apartments in Spain with two rooms and 23 people per apartment average consumption should be around 6 kWhday. The average electricity consumption for a single detached home 1800 ft 2 is 8292 kWh per year or about 691 kWh per month.
