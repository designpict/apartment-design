<p>Garbage chutes are essential to apartment buildings and make for an effective way to dispose of trash. Trash piles up at the bottom of the chute where a device eventually crushes it into smaller blocks of trash. And it helps to have the dumpster emptied more than once a week and also cleaned every so often. There are rooms on every floor that give building residents access to the chute so they can throw their trash away without having to trek down to the basement or wherever garbage is collected.

<p>Many high- and mid-rise buildings have trash chutes especially in apartments or condominium buildings where many people are living in one building. Sound dampening coating can be applied to outside of chute to minimize noise emitted by the chute. The garbage chute system is a long vertical space passing by each floor of a building but its not a black hole. A chute is like a gigantic chimney in the middle of your building.
