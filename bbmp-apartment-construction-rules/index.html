If any building constructed without getting proper approval from the BBMP in the Bangalore city then the authority has the power to demolish the building or levy a lump sum amount as. So the banks decision is based on the likelyhood of your not paying the loan amount and in that case if the bank sells the flat waht amount it may get for it. Similarly the purchaser or transferee of the apartment shall immediately apart from executing and registering an instrument in the form FORM-A as provided for in clause ii of sub-section 3 of Section 4 of the West Bengal Apartment Ownership Act 1972 notify the Board concerned about his ownership or interest as the case may be of the apartment in question.
